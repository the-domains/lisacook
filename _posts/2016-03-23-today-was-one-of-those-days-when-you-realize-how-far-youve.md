Today was one of those days when you realize how far you've fallen. How did I go from Queen of My Universe- which had not boundaries, to being the loneliest person trapped in a house I hate in in a town I tolerate because of a FEW decent folks, in a state I loathe. 

Trapped. Uneducated. Small kids. I have nowhere to go. Now that there is no more TEAM COOK, I cant get far enough away from him. SO now we're both on our own, and the delusion I held otherwise ended up being a lie. I could make him stay with this parents and stress everybody out. Especially the kids. But, sadly,, I don't even care. Let him be the bad guy for once. Let him figure it out on his own. I'm done. So, so done. We probably should have just separated right away instead of trying todo it alone, yet somehow beside each other. Too much resentment. It takes too much energy to eve try.  I need to talk. He can't. I feel trapped. He doesnt seem to care. He feels trapped too.  It always come down to the girls. Focus on them. Taking care of them. Like they dont know. Like they cant see. They remember how it used to be and they miss him too.

I search the web looking for somewhere to go. ANYWHERE but here. I used to enjoy going to New York, and Europe and Cruises--Oh, the Cruises, but that's all pretty much out.  Maybe I can find a place Trey would have hated. Somehow, I think his absence will still be a presence. A presence so overwhelming, you cant see past it no matter where you are. 

"Cause I never thought I'd lose,

I only thought I'd win..."

These lyrics over and over haunt me.  How could I be such a fool. How could I not appreciate what I had. How can he be gone. How can I face a world that he's not in. That knows nothing of his laughter, and spirit and generosity and love. He had so much love to give in a world that desperately needs it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7aab1559-f022-4fc8-b699-dc833e71dc7f.jpg)

The truth is, I don't want to get better. I don't want to get over him or carry on, a shell of what I was, because my heart is gone. Everyone's live went on but ours.  and being stuck, frozen in what was but can never be is its own hell.

I desperately need to know that he's ok. That he knows how loved and cherished he is.  How sorry I am for the millions of ways I let him down every day. When doing my best, was really, just what I wanted or what was easiest at the time. How proud we were of him. How we loved watching him mature into such a fine young man. All the hopes and dreams we had for him. 

Another night without sleep. Ruminating. Trying to remember and hold on to every second.  Wishing I'd played closer attention. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df54149e-e1d1-4899-8592-d8098da1fecc.jpg)

It never occurred to me, in a million years, that we could ever lose him, my larger than life son; my sweet boy.
